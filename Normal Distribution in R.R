# x, q	--> vector of quantiles.
# p	--> vector of probabilities.
# n	--> number of observations. If length(n) > 1, the length is taken to be the number required.
# mean --> vector of means.
# sd --> vector of standard deviations.
# log, log.p --> logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p).
# lower.tail --> logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are P[X â‰¤ x], otherwise, P[X > x].
